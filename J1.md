## Question 1
### Fault localization
Use **print statements** or a **debugger** to trace through your program and find where it deviates from expected values. 

## Question 2
### Benifits of test driven development
- Allows you to check that your code works properly
- Means that you have an idea of what is correct before you start writing your code
- Allows users that wish to build off your code to know what is valid and invalid.
