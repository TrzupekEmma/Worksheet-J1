## Question 1
### Fault localization
Use **print statements** or a **debugger** to trace through your program and find where it deviates from expected values. 

## Question 2
### Benifits of test driven development
- Allows you to check that your code works properly
- Means that you have an idea of what is correct before you start writing your code
- Allows users that wish to build off your code to know what is valid and invalid. 

## Question 3
### Partitioning data
partitions
- empty string
  - every clause is wrong
    - a few variations that have multiple clauses be false
  - doesn't have a number
- doesn't have an uppercase letter
  - doesn't have a lowercase letter 
    - has the website gmail
- has a non letter, number or underscore value
  - has a number, uppercase letter, lowercase letter, doesn't have the website gmail and doesn't have a non alphanumeric or underscore value 

## Question 4
### Truth Table

| A>B | G | X<Y | predicate outcome | clause responsible |
| --- |---| --- |        ---        |        ---         |
| F   | F |  F  |     F             |  A>B,   G,   X<Y   |
| T   | F |  F  |     F             |     X<Y            |
| F   | T |  F  |     F             |      X<Y           |
| T   | T |  F  |     F             |    X<Y             |
| F   | F |  T  |     F             |    A>B,    G       |
| T   | F |  T  |     T             |    A>B,   G,   X<Y |
| F   | T |  T  |     T             |    G   X<Y         |
| T   | T |  T  |     T             |   A>B   G   X<Y    |

## Question 5
### Graph Tracing
```
{1->2->5->6->7,
1->2->5->7,
1->2->3->6->7,
1->2->3->7}
```
this set plus an infinite set of the form
```
1->2->3->4->3->5->6->7 OR
1->2->3->4->3->5->7
```
where the 3->4->3 can be looped infinitely

Infinite Set


## Question 6
### mutation testing
[Mutation Testing](https://cs2113-f24.github.io/j/software_testing#syntactic-structures) allows you to test your tests by varying your code. If your tests say that it's true in what is broken code you need to change it.
